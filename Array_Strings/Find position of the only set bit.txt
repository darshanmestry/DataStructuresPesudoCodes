This problem means when a no is passed how many no of 1s it will have in a binary representaion

we have to find if there is only one ocurence of 1 

so for that we check if no is of power 2 if it is then only it will have only 1 and rest o
n&(n-1)==0

take i as 0 and pos to store position
run while loop till i>0

and shift the bits x=x<<1

and increase the poss

int the end pos will have the index of 1

int findPos(int n)
{

    int i=1,pos=1;

    if(n>0 && (n&(n-1)==0))
    {
        while(i&n==0)
        {
            i=i<<1
            pos++;  
        }
        return
    }

}
