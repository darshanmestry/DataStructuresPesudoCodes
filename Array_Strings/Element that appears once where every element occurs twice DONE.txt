Given an array of integers. All numbers occur twice except one number which occurs once. Find the number in O(n) time & constant extra space.

Example :

Input:  ar[] = {7, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4}
Output: 7 

this can be achived by doing xor on all the elemnts of i and storin the result
finaly the appearing only once will remain

store 1st element in res and iterate from 1st element

int findSingleElement(int[] a)
{
	int res=a[0];
	for(int i=1;i<a.length;i++)
	{
		res=res^a[i]
	}

	return res
}
