This is a simple level order taveral just we pass the k to the fucntion and when k=0 we print 
other wise we recursibly call the function by for the left and right sutree and pass value of k as k-1

o(n) where n is the no of nodes in a binray tree

void printKDistanceNodes(Node* root,int k)
{
	if(root==null)
		return
	if(k==0)
	{
		print root->data
		return
	}
	else
	{
		printKDistanceNodes(root->left,k-1)
		printKDistanceNodes(root->right,k-1)
	}
}
